Data: IBM HR Attrition: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

## Introduction

Human Resources is an essential department for almost all the firms. Nowaday, there is a significant increase in employee turnover in many industries and that led to a high extra cost for the firms. Employee attrition is an important topic for a company's development: a low turnover rate usually linked to high productivity, expected profit, and stability of the firm. Therefore, it is important to understand what leads to this situation and what can we do to mitigate it. My research question is to find out what is the most influential factor that determines an employeeâ€™s willingness of attrition using IBM HR attrition dataset, a feature selection research. I built two models in this paper: one self-designed logistic regression with KNN and a commonly used SVM method. Then compare the results of both and find out the most influential factors.
